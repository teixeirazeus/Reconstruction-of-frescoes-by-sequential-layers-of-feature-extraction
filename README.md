This repository contains the code developed for the [Digital Anastylosis of Frescoes challeNgE DAFNE](https://vision.unipv.it/DAFchallenge/DAF-notice.html) hosted by the Universit√† degli Studi di Pavia.

Within this codebase, you'll find the implementation of two innovative methods:

- [Retention Layers Method]
- Middle Triangle Method

For a detailed understanding of these methods, please refer to our published [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865521001422) or my [Bachelor's Thesis](https://repositorio.utfpr.edu.br/jspui/handle/1/26470) in portuguese.
